Hi there! 
<br> 
<br> 
I'm Noel, an IT student majoring in Computer Science, with a minor in Finance; at QUT in Brisbane CBD.
<br> 
<br> 
I have developed full stack applications that work with Stock Market APIs and financial markets, participated in a blockchain hackathon (Ethereum) and serving as an executive in a CyberSecurity club, running at my university. 
<br>
<br>
Outside of work, I love cycling, reading books and working on open source projects with my friends. If you'd like to know more about me, or have any queries, leave an email: noel_emmanuel (at) pm.me or click on the top-right icons to find my GitHub
