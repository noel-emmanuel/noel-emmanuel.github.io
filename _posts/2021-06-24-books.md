Here is a list of books that I liked and recommend to friends. I added short notes so you can get an idea. Enjoy :)

<h5>Berean Study Bible by multiple authors</h5>
I'm not that ecstatic religious person, but The Bible does have great stories, lessons, and wisdom that are really applicaple to life. You'll read about the mistakes people made, growing wealth, love, but most importantly living a honest, faithful and serene life. It also makes you think about, life after death. Berean Study Bible was also very accessible and great to read on my Kindle!

<h5>The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason</h5>
This is the first book I read about managing money and understanding finance in general (first principles). Reading this book while working my first part-time job allowed me to put the concepts into practice. This worked out really well, and set the stage for my first investment into a business. Timeless wisdom and brilliantly written.

<h5>Born a Crime by Trevor Noah</h5>
A fantastic read and great storylines. Throughout the book, you'll find that Trevor's mother, trained her son on how to live a good life and following the right path (also doing his Christian duties!); and Trevor achieved exactly that; only after missteps and hurdles. Again, great wisdom on navigating life. If you liked this book, then you will also like: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell.
