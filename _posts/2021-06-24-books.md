Here is a list of books that I liked and recommend to friends. I added short notes so you can get an idea. Enjoy :)

1. The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason
    * This is the first book I read about managing money and understanding finance in general (first principles). Reading this book while working my first part-time job allowed me to put the concepts into practice. This worked out really well, and set the stage for my first investment into a business. Timeless wisdom and brilliantly written.

1. Born a Crime by Trevor Noah
    * A fantastic read and great storylines. Throughout the book, you'll find that Trevor's mother, trained her son on how to live a good life and following the right path (also doing his Christian duties!); and Trevor achieved exactly that; only after missteps and hurdles. Again, great wisdom on navigating life.
